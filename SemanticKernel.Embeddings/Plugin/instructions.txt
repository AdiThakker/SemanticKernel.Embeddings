SELECT statement for agent workspaces should follow this format:
- FROM the table [workspace_name]
- SELECT all columns where status = 'active'
- The query should be limited to 100 results.

If a workspace has more than 1 table, join them on the 'id' field. The First Column is the workspace name and the second and the third columns are table names
